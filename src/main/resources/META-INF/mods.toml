description='''
    A Minecraft Forge mod which does the following things:
    * Adds Fragile Glass (including stained and pane versions), made with sugar and water
    * Adds Thin Ice which breaks underfoot unless stepped on carefully
    * Adds Weak Stone (disabled by default) which crumbles into gravel on contact
    * Adds configuration for practically any block (vanilla or any mod) so that it can break, update, change or fall down when something collides with it hard enough
    * Adds configuration for how fast different entities have to be travelling to break a fragile block
