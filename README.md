# Fragile-Glass
Fragile Glass and Thin Ice is a Minecraft Forge mod which does the following things:
* Adds Fragile Glass (including stained and pane versions), made with sugar and water
* Adds Thin Ice which breaks underfoot unless stepped on carefully
* Adds Weak Stone (disabled by default) which crumbles into gravel on contact
* Adds configuration for practically any block (vanilla or any mod) so that it can break, update, change or fall down when something collides with it hard enough
* Adds configuration for how fast different entities have to be travelling to break a fragile block

This is for versions of the mod for Minecraft 1.8 upwards.
For Minecraft 1.7.10, see [the Fragile-Glass-1.7.10 repo](https://github.com/fredtargaryen/Fragile-Glass-1.7.10).
