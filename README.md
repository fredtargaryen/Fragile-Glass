# Fragile-Glass
Fragile Glass and Thin Ice is a Minecraft Forge mod which does the following things:
* Adds Fragile Glass (including stained and pane versions), made with sugar and water
* Adds Thin Ice which breaks underfoot unless stepped on carefully
* Adds Weak Stone (disabled by default) which crumbles into gravel on contact.
This is for versions of the mod for Minecraft 1.8 upwards.
For version 1.7.10, see the repo Fragile-Glass-1.7.10.
